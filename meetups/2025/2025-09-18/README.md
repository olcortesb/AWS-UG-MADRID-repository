### ðŸŽ¯ Kubernetes as a Platform: From Infrastructure as Code to API-DRIVEN
**Speaker**: Shani Kazaz

**Abstract**: How leveraging Kubernetes for Platform Engineering can drastically increase development efficiency, simplify operations, and enable unprecedented scalability through Kubernetes-native GitOps. This session will explore how the Kubernetes API becomes the cornerstone of GitOps practices, solving key challenges in cloud resource management and large-scale infrastructure. Learn how this Kubernetes-centric approach enables teams to declaratively manage thousands of resources in complex environments using familiar Kubernetes objects and methodologies. We'll show how platform abstractions help overcome complex challenges and how automation aligns with Kubernetes controller principles using open-source tools. Explore how the powerful combination of Kro, ArgoCD, and ACK extends the Kubernetes API to drive GitOps for both applications and infrastructure, revolutionizing platform engineering in EKS through a truly Kubernetes-native GitOps approach.
